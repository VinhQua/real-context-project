    <p>I am a <span>responsive designer & developer</span> who thrives on visual storytelling. when I'm not working, pursuing side projects or 
    getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs & books, I can be found traveling, hiking and searching for new stories.</p>

                <p>I was born and raised in NYC, but <strong>my real roots</strong> reach to South America. 
                I owe my travel bug to being a first generation American with family all over the world - we were always on the go!</p>

                <p><strong>My passion: </strong><span>i love</span> music - it's one of the most powerful and diverse methods for expression & communication.
                In the meantime, I get my fix by going to lots & lots of concerts. I'm at 160 and counting!</p>

                <p><strong>A fun fact:</strong> As a true New Yorker, I'm slightly embarassed to say that I only kearned
                how to ride a plain ol'station bike 1 year ago, and have yet to learn to drive. But, the real takeaway is that
                I'm learning!</p>
